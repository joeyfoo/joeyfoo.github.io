Hello! I'm Joey, and I'm a software developer, a photographer, and a public transport enthusiast. 

You may know me from some of the things I do: 

* I'm a moderator on [the official Rainbow Six Discord server](https://discord.gg/rainbow6). 
* I'm a tech for the [Nerd<sup>3</sup> Fanservers](http://n3fs.co.uk/).

Other things I did: 

* [**SGTrains.com**](http://www.sgtrains.com/) -- I designed and developed the current website for SGTrains, a group of local train enthusiasts.
* [**C751A for openBVE**]({% link _projects/openbve-c751a.md %}) and [**SgATC**](https://github.com/joeyfoo/SgATC) -- train add-ons for the free openBVE train simulator
* [**My SP app**]({% link _projects/mysp.md %}) -- a Windows Phone app for Singapore Polytechnic students

You can find more on [the Projects page]({% link projects.md %}).

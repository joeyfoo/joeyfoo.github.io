description: Have a project idea? Let's talk! I'm looking for side projects to work on during my term break.

I've just finished a semester of university and am on term break, so I'm looking for side projects to work on! 

**If you have a project idea, let's [get in touch](/contact)!**

## What I can do:

* **Software development**: Have an app idea? Working on an Rainbow Six cosplay and want an app that simulates a gadget?  
I might be able to help! I'm a Computer Science undergrad, with previous working experience in software development. 

* **Web design and development**: Need a website? I've built multiple sites from simple landing sites to full websites. 

* **Brand identity and graphic design**: Need some graphic design work done? I've worked on brand identity and graphic design before.  
My work includes stream overlays, graphics ([such as those on the Rainbow 6 Discord](https://siege.dangeraspect.xyz/infographics)), and more.

You can also find a selection of past works in the [My Work](/projects) section of the site. 

## Rates and Compensation

I will charge a reasonable hourly rate. Scope and time estimates will be agreed upon before I commence work. 

Any compensation will go towards my savings for university expenses or towards [my cosplay](https://twitter.com/joeyfjj/status/1204411818094944256). 

That said, **if you have a cool project that sounds really fun**, I might be open to working on it pro bono! 

## Let's get in touch!

You can ping me on Twitter or Discord, drop me an email, or [complete the form here](/contact)! I look forward to hearing from you.

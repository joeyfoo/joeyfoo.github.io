You can send me a tweet on Twitter [@joeyfjj](https://twitter.com/joeyfjj) or a message on Discord to `joeyfjj#0001`. 

Alternatively, drop me an email at `hello at joeyfoo.com`. 

Please **do not** add me to mailing lists or send anything that you're sending to a group of people.

## How not to contact me

Messages sent via Facebook/Messenger will likely never be seen. I don't use Facebook nowadays. 

Shouting my name at the top of your voice -- especially in public places -- is also not welcome.

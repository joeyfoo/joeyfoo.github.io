## University

I'm back in school! 

It's term time, so my weekdays are mostly spent on campus or working on projects. 

## Echo cosplay

I'm working on my first ever cosplay! 

It's [Echo](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-gb/game-info/operators/echo/index.aspx) from Rainbow Six: Siege, and I can't wait to finish it for Singapore Comic Con on 7-8 December 2019! 

I intend to post a retrospective on this project once I'm done too.

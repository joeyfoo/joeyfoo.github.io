title: "Want some Humble Bundle keys?"

I've bought several [Humble Bundles](https://www.humblebundle.com/) over the years, and I just realised I've quite a collection of game keys left unclaimed!

I've decided to give away these keys instead of letting them sit in my inventory forever. They're claimable via Steam (except those in the Origin Bundle). I *may* decide to keep some of these keys for myself, though. 

<p class="lead">If you're interested in any of these keys, please drop me a message <a href="/contact">on Twitter or Discord</a>.</p>

The Nerd続 Fanservers (N3FS) was formed to replace the official NerdCubed Servers which closed down in 2016. 

I am an administrator on the Nerd続 Fanservers (N3FS). My roles includes being a sysadmin, moderating the server and providing support to users. 

I also built and maintain [the server's website](https://n3fs.co.uk/). 

N3FS runs on Ubuntu Server, and uses Paper for the Minecraft server software. The website is hosted on the same server and is served via Nginx.

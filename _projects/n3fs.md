The Nerd³ Fanservers (N3FS) is a fan-run community, formed by players from the official NerdCubed Servers which closed down in 2016. 

I am an administrator on N3FS. My roles includes maintaining the game servers, moderating, and providing support to users. I also built and maintain [the server's website](https://n3fs.co.uk/). 

N3FS runs on Ubuntu Server, and uses Paper for the Minecraft server software.

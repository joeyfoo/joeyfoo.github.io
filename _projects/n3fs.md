The Nerd続 Fanservers (N3FS) was formed to replace the official NerdCubed Servers which closed down in 2016. 

I am an administrator on the Nerd続 Fanservers (N3FS). My roles includes being a sysadmin, moderating the server and providing support to users. I also built and maintain the server's website. 

N3FS runs on Ubuntu Server, and uses Paper for the Minecraft server software. The website is hosted on the same server and is served via Nginx.

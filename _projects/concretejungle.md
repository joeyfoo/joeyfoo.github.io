[Operation Concrete Jungle](https://concretejungle.dangeraspect.xyz/) is a fan-made Rainbow Six: Siege operation, led by [@hanjosi](https://twitter.com/hanjosi) with contributions from the rest of the [team](https://concretejungle.dangeraspect.xyz/credits). Set in Thailand, the project includes concepts two new operators, a new map, short stories, and accompanying artwork.

I designed and developed the website, as well as contributing to artwork, writing, and map design. 

## Technology 

The website is a static site, with Jekyll used as the generator. It's coded from a clean sheet, and does not rely on an existing theme/design. 

GitHub is our source code repository, with Azure DevOps providing Continuous Integration, automatically building changes and uploading the site to Azure Blob Storage. The site is fronted by CloudFlare.

<p class="lead">My SP is a unofficial Windows Phone 8 app that provides Singapore Polytechnic students with quick access to their timetables and more.</p>

The app provides a quick peek of the next two lessons and provides access to the full student timetable. It also includes other tools, including SP Cam and the campus map.

This app is no longer being maintained, but will continue to remain on the store. I've also [written a blog post about the development process and future of the app](/posts/about-mysp/).
